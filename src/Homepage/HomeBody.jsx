                        Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jen, a student at the University of Western Ontario pursuing a <b>dual degree in Computer Science and Business Administration</b>. Beyond the technical stuff, I enjoy music, fitness, and aviation.

                        My whole life, I've loved mixing art, technology, and problem solving. As a kid, I spent hours playing with MS Paint and other apps that came with my computer. In grade four, I was introduced to coding and design, and it was exactly what I wanted to learn more about. Building simple games became my favorite creative outlet; I was able to turn abstract ideas into solid product.
